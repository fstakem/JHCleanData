## Abstract
This project was undertaken for the Data Science class 'Getting and Cleaning Data' from John Hopkins offered through Coursera. The R code takes data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and processes it into a a tidy data set as per the project instructions. The raw data can be found on the course web site and in the folder '/raw_data' in this project. More details about the processing can be found below.

## Summary
The goal of the project was to collect the feature data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and to provide the mean for a subset of the features. The features were to be grouped by a subjects's actions. Since there where 30 subjects and 6 actions this called called for 180 seperate groupings. Once the data was grouped per the subject's actions the mean was taken only of the features that were a mean or a std. In short this created a mean for each of the separate feature vectors that were either a mean or a std.
